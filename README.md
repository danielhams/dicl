# dicl

## Irix Compatibility Library

A little test project to see what is practically possible in terms of replacing broken or missing functionality in Irix libc.

Currently only supports a replacement 'printf' when using gcc.

Build the 'libdicl' and install somewhere, then build the 'dicltester' that exercises it.
